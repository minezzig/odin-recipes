  <ol>
      <li>Start boiling water for your rigatoni, cook according to package instructions.</li>
      <li>While you are bringing water to a boil, drain the soaked cashews then add them, the
        vegetable broth, nutritional yeast and lemon juice to a blender. Blend on high until nice
        and smooth scraping down the sides as needed. It may take a few minutes. Now add salt
        and pepper to taste. Just leave in the blender for a few minutes until you need it.</li>
      <li>Once the water is boiling, cook your pasta until it is al dente. Drain when finished.</li>
      <li>In the mean time, heat the olive oil in a large skillet, on medium high. Add the garlic and
        saute for a minute. Then add the spinach and sun dried tomatoes. Season with a pinch
        of salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Cook for a few minutes until the spinach has wilted and the sun dried tomatoes are soft.
        Add the wine and simmer for about 5 minutes. Reduce heat as needed. </li>
      <li>Now stir in the cashew cream sauce until completely combined. Taste and adjust
        seasoning adding more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
      <li>7. Turn the heat off and add the rigatoni to the skillet. Toss the pasta in the sauce and coat
        completely. Serve immediately! I topped mine with fresh basil and cracked black pepper!</li>
